Project Epitech in C

Subject:

You all know the very famous Battleship game. Well, I hope so. You must code a terminal version of this game. The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2. The map size is 8x8.
At the end of the game, you must display whether I won or Enemy won 
This project passes 70% of the tests, moreover I carried out tests in expect language.

Usage:

./navy [first_player_pid] navy_positions

first_player_pid: only for the 2nd player. pid of the first player. navy_positions: file representing the positions of the ships
